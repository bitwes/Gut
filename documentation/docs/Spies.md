# Spies
When a `double` is instanced, Gut will record calls to methods that are defined in the script or scripts it inherits from.  You can then make assertions to check if a method was called, not called, passed certain values, or how many times it was called.

You should read the page on doubling before using this, as there are some gotchas with doubling.

__You can only spy on methods that have been included in the Double.  Built-in functions (such as `set_position`) are not doubled by default, so you cannot spy on them unless you have set the [Double Strategy](Double-Strategy).__

## Spy Related Methods
The following methods can be used to "spy" on doubled objects.  They are available in any script that extends [GutTest](class_GutTest).
