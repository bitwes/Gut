* [Command Line Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ7NVJOpemg&t=9s) Starts with an empty project and installs GUT, creates tests, and covers a bunch of command line options all without ever launching the Godot editor.
* [TDD and PONG Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF2gPF69Dc4&t=3s) First in a series of videos implementing Pong using a TDD approach.  Starts with an empty project and implements the Ball.
* [TDD and PONG Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNN0Xw1R_1E&t=2s) Continues from episode 1.  This episode implements the walls and covers some simple doubling, stubbing, and spying.
* [TDD and PONG Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf8U_XI4BHw&t=10s)In this episode we make the paddle and make the ball bounce off the paddle.  We use some spies to verify calls to methods and verify some random output.  Pretty good fun.
* [TDD and PONG Episode IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmS_VfUPOo8&t=47s)In this episode we end up with a working, if not simple, game.  Paddles move, scores are kept, and the game ends.

* [Mocking Input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRKppa9R7ZQ) Implements double jump in the Godot 2D Platformer by using the `InputSender` class in some integration tests.
