### Creating Tests for GUT

#### All GUT tests are found in
* `res://test/unit`
* `res://test/integration`

Edit existing scripts or add new ones there.

#### Any resources needed by tests should be placed in:
* `res://test/resources`

If you don't see an existing directory that matches your needs then you can create a new directory or place them directly in `res://test/resources`.


### Running GUT Tests
Due to the nature of using the tool to test the tool, there are some are pending or risky.  These ar ebeing cleaned up, but there might be some.  You should run all the tests once before developing to see see which currently exist.

Here's some common errors:

#### The GUT Panel doesn't do anything.
Sometimes when you edit GUT files, the plugin doesn't like it.  Reload the plugin.

#### If you see this in the IDE Output
```
res://addons/gut/gui/GutBottomPanel.gd:### - Invalid get index '<whatever>' (on base: 'Nil').
```
Then reload the plugin.
