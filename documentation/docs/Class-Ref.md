# About ClassRef

The ClassRef is a work in progress.  Documentation might be sparse for some files.  Listings may change.  The important thing is that it is being generated now, so we got that going for us...which is nice.

## Internal Use
Anything marked as "internal use" is for internal use.  You probably shouldn't use these things.  They may change or be removed.  If you find yourself using one of these, open an issue on Github and let me know and maybe I can make it available for public consumption.

Why included them if they shouldn't be used?  Probably because I wasn't sure if they would be useful.  I'm also struggling with making "complete documentation" versus "what the user needs to see".  Also, I added an "@internal" annotation to the parser that generates the documentation and I wanted to try it out.

Feedback is always welcome.
