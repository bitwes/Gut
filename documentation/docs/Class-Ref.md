# About Class Reference

These pages are generated from code comments, making the same information available both in the wiki and through the Editor's help.  The code to generate these pages has been adapted from the Godot Engine's code used to generate its wiki.

This is a work in progress and will become more complete over time.


## Internal Use
Anything marked as "internal use" is for internal use.  You probably shouldn't use these things.  They may change or be removed without warning.  If you find yourself using one of these, open an issue on Github and let me know and maybe I can make it available for public consumption.

Why included them if they shouldn't be used?  Probably because I wasn't sure if they would be useful.  Also, I added an "@internal" annotation to the parser that generates the documentation and I wanted to try it out.

Feedback is always welcome.
