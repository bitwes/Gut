# Documentation Todo list

## Inner-Test-Classes.md
I do not know if the following is still true:

"Also the line number for the tests cannot currently be reported when they fail or are pending (they aren’t parsed the same way as normal script tests, I’ll probably add this in later since it bugs me)."

## Asserts-and-Methods
* Add `assert_same` and `assert_not_same`.


## Mocking Input
Add something to Mocking-Input.md

Add a page for simulating clicks and what not.


## Export Test Results
Figure out if this is broke or not.
