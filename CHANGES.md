# Release notes
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

# 7.1.0
## Misc
* `prerun_setup`, `setup`, `teardown`, `postrun_teardown` deprecation warnings have been enabled.  These were removed from the documentation over 2 years ago (6.6.0) and replaced with `before_all`, `before_each`, `after_each`, and `after_all`.  Having to make additional changes for these in order to implement __Issue 184__ annoyed me, so there will now be depracation warnings for these.  Earliest they could be removed is 8.0.0.

## Features
* __Issue 201__ Added `pass_test(text)`, `fail_test(text)`, `is_passing()`, `is_failing()` methods to `test.gd`.
* __Issue 184__ Asserts in `before_all` and `after_all` are now formally supported.  They will appear correctly in the output and asserts will be tracked in the summary.

## Bug Fixes
* Command Line now returns 1 if no sripts could be loaded.
* __Issue 173__ An error is generated if try to `stub` the `_init` method.  Documentation has been updated.
* __Issue 195__ Parameterized Tests generated deprecated warnings.
* Fixed various issues with parameterized tests.  All  test execution is now treated exactly the same (__Issue 196__, __Issue 197__, __Issue 202__)
* __Issue 199__ If you pass an instance of something to `double` or `partial_double` a GUT error is generated and `null` is returned.
* __Issue 200__ If you pass a non-doubled instance to `stub` a GUT error is generated and nothing is stubbed.
* __Issue 211__ GDNative scripts cause `Error calling built-in function 'inst2dict': Not a script with an instance` when used in assertions

# 7.0.0
## Breaking Changes
* Requires Godot 3.2.  Versions 3.1 and earlier are no longer supported.
* You must recreate the GUT node in your test runner scene.
  * Take notes on your GUT settings in the editor.
  * Delete GUT from the tree and add it back in.
  * You may have to restart Godot after this change.
  * Repopulate your settings.
* All Doubles and Partial Doubles are freed automatically after each test.  Doubles and Partial Doubles created in `before_all` will no longer be around for all tests.
* A new signal `gut_ready` should be used instead of `_ready` when performing any actions on the GUT object in your test runner scene.  You should avoid interacting with GUT until this signal has been emitted.
* `gut.p` no longer supports the 3rd optional parameter for indent level.  The parameter still exists but does nothing and generates a deprecation warning.

### Potentially Breaking Changes
* The order the tests are run is no longer guaranteed.  This has been the case with Inner Test cases but it's now true for all tests.
* The order that Inner Test classes are run is no longer guaranteed.


## Features
* __Issue 114__ By popular demand [Parameterized Tests](https:/github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/ParameterizedTests) have been added.  You can now create a tests that will be run multiple times and fed a list of parameters.  (This feature opened up a giant can of worms for logging which led to more cans and more worms.)
* Added [Memory Management](https:/github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Memory-Management) tools.
  * Logging of orphan counts.
  * Warnings for children added to tests that are not freed.
  * New assert:  `assert_no_new_orphans`
  * New utility methods:  `autofree`, `autoqfree`, `add_child_autofree`, `add_child_autoqfree`.
* __Issue 168__ Added "user directory" file viewer to additional options for viewing logs on a device.  See [Running on Devices](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Running-On-Devices#logging)
* __Issue 167__ Added more areas where filenames are printed when printing objects.
* Redesigned logging to be more consistent across the GUT control, terminal, and Godot console (here be the cans and worms).
* Can now set the font (from a few choices), font size, font color, and the background color!
* Some GUI tweaks.

## Bug Fixes
* Thanks to hilfazer for contributing a PR that addressed most of the memory leaks in GUT.  This PR also inspired most of the new Memory Management features.

### Relevant Wiki Links
* Added a [Quick-Start wiki page](https:/github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Quick-Start).
* [Memory Management page](https:/github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Memory-Management) for all your memory management needs and questions.
* [Parameterized Tests](https:/github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Parameterized-Tests).

# 6.8.3
## Features
* Added filename and inner class paths to "expected" and "got" values in asserts.  For example you'll see `[Node:1234](my_script.gd)` now instead of just `[Node:1234]`.  Types are also included where appropriate.  For example `Color(1,1,1,1)` instead of `(1,1,1,1)` but a strings and numbers aren't changed.
* Text is now wrapped in the display.  If you hate it let me know and I'll add a flag.

## Bug Fixes
* [Xrayez found an issue with the signal watcher](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/pull/158) in 3.2.2 and fixed it.
* __Issue 147__ Some built-ins could not be doubled because the underlying class starts with an underscore.  This was discovered for `File`.  These are now detected and handled.
* __Issue 149__ Using `assert_almost_eq` no longer breaks all the beautiful colors in the display.
* __Issue 157/160__ GDScript templates used for doubling now have a `.txt` extension instead of `.gd`.  This was causing issues with warnings and exporting tests.  If you want to export your tests you must now include `*.txt` files.  A warning was added if the templates are missing.

# 6.8.2
## Features
* __Issue 113__ ssd71 added asserts `assert_connected` and  `assert_not_connected` which allow you to assert an object is connected to a signal.
* Added some colors to the console output.  This is disabled by default in the editor and enabled by default at the command line.   The colors don't work in the Godot console.  Each has options to enable/disable them.
* __Issue 138__ Added `assert_typeof` and `assert_not_typeof`.
* Doubles are now created in memmory instead of creating temporary files.  This does not change how they are used, just how they are created on the backend.

## Bug Fixes
* When running a single Inner Class GUT generated a lot of `ERROR: get_as_ratio: Cannot get ratio when minimum and maximum value are equal.` due to changes in 3.2.  These have been corrected.
* Cleaned up some warnings.

# 6.8.1
## Features
* Godot 3.2 compatible.
* __Issue 124__ CodeDarigan added the `assert_freed` and `assert_not_freed` methods.
* __Issue 130__ GUT now lists the exact line number of a failing test in all cases instead of just the method number in non-inner classes.  Thanks to mschulzeLpz for adding `get_stack` magic.
* __Issue 133__ You can now double/partial_double/stub/spy Native classes like `Node2D` and `Raycast2D`.  Syntax is the same.
* __Issue 139__ There are now `pre` and `post` run script hooks that allow you to run your own code before any tests are run and after all tests are run.  This can be useful in setting global values before a run or investigating the results of the run for CICD pipelines and  the like.  [Check the wiki for more info](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Hooks)

## Bug Fixes
* __Issue 127__ The method `ignore_method_when_doubling` was added as a workaround for doubling scripts that have static methods.  The "Doubles" wiki page has more info about this method.
* __Issue 136__ Bug can happen when yielding where a `attempt to disconnect signal...while emitting` can occur.  Disconnecting from signals is now done via `call_deferred`.

# 6.8.0
## Features
* __Issue 98__ Added Stubbing method `to_call_super` so that you can force a doubled object to call its super method instead of being stubbed out.
* Added Stubbing method `to_do_nothing`.  This allows you to be a little more deliberate in your stubbing and is more readable than `to_return(null)` which is basically all it does.  It also suppresses un-stubbed method messages.
* __Issue 115__ Partial doubles can now be created with the `partial_double` method.  This will give you an object that has all of its methods stubbed `to_call_super`.  So it will act the same as a normal object, but you can spy and stub methods on it as well.
* Experimental FULL doubling is now working in Godot 3.1.
* Experimental FULL doubling now stubs all supported built-ins `to_call_super` under the covers.  This means you can stub methods you haven't overloaded in your class (before you could only spy on them).
* __Issue 105__ Added `-gexit_on_success` option to the command line to only exit if all tests passed.
* Added `get_version` method to `Gut.gd`.

## Bug Fixes
* Housekeeping, typos and some unused variables.
* __Issue 108__ Maximize doesn't move back to 0,0.
* Xrayez fixed __Issue 109__.
* __Issue 117__ The Spying related methods now fail if you don't pass an array for the list of expected parameters.  Something I forgot about when making "TDD and P O N G" episode 2.  You can watch it and enjoy me forgetting how to use my own tool.
* Exporting tests in 3.1 appears to be working now.  Could not reproduce original issue.
* __Issue 111__ Tests are now sorted.


# 6.7.0
## Upgrade Instructions
* It is not required, but you should remove the existing Gut node for any scenes you have that use it and then re-add it and re-configure it.  Re-adding will get rid of the caution symbol next to the control (this is due to changes in inheritance, Gut changed from a `WindowDialog` to a `Control`)
* For the command line, note that the `log` option in the `.gutconfig.json` file has changed to `log_level` for consistency.

## Features
* 3.1 Compatible (with a few very minor issues, [check them out here](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Godot-3.1-Issues).)
* __Issue 73__ <u>You can now export your tests</u> and run them in your exported game!  This means you can run your tests on all the platforms that Godot supports through the executable...no editor, no nothing!  Check out the Export Tests wiki page for more information.
* __Issue 102__ Added `get_call_parameters` which allows you to get the parameters sent to a call to a doubled method.  It returns the most recent call by default but you can specify an optional index as well.
* __Issue 103__ Added `replace_node` which allows you to replace a node in a scene with another node by specifying the node path.  This makes testing scenes that use the `$` syntax to get a reference to a child node easier to test by giving you a quick way to inject a double of any child node.  The node that was replaced is freed with `queue_free`
* <u>A brand new GUI</u>.  It looks a lot like the old GUI but it is new.  With the ability to export tests I wanted the GUI to be more mobile friendly.  So I threw the old one out (which was a relic of the days when Gut was one script...the old GUI was made entirely with code) and created a scene which will make GUI changes soooo much easier going forward.
* `-gprint_gutconfig_sample` command line option will print you a full config file that you can start using.

## Fixes/Improvements
* __Issue 104__ Added all missing settings to the gutconfig file.
  * For consistency the `log` option in the .gutconfig changed to `log_level`.
* Improved logging.  More warnings and errors have been added to help when something goes wrong inside Gut.  The number of Gut related errors, warnings, and deprecated methods are listed in the summary.  If you don't see any listed, there aren't any.
* A lot of housekeeping and Boy Scouting.

## Removals
* You can no longer set the selected script when adding scripts one by one via `add_script`.  If you pass a 2nd parameter an error is generated, but everything will continue to run.
* Deprecated the following methods:
  * `end_test` and the old `gut.end_yielded_test`.  These no longer need to be called.
  * `assert_get_set_methods` was replaced with `assert_accessors` awhile ago.  In this release I added deprecation messages for this method.  It still works, but wanted to start getting the message out.
  * `assert_extends` has been replaced with `assert_is` to match the 3.0 names.
* Stop button was removed.  It didn't really work that well anyhow.  I could be convinced to put it back.

# 6.6.3
Was exporting a directory that I shouldn't, added it to the .gitattributes

# 6.6.2
## Features
* `assert_null` and `assert_not_null`
* added `simulate` to the test object so you no longer have to use `gut` when calling it.  It is fine if you still do though.  Sorry if this breaks something.
* Doubling, Stubbing, and Spies are no longer considered experimental.
* The `double` method is now smart:
  * It knows when you pass it a scene or a script, no need for `double_scene` anymore but it remains.
  * You can pass it a loaded class or scene like this:
  ```
  var MyClass = load('res://my_class.gd')
  var MyClassDouble = double(MyClass)
  ```
* You can now `double` Inner Classes by passing an Inner Class path like so:
  ```
  double('res://my_script.gd', 'Inner1/InnerInInner1/AndSoOn')
  ```
* The start of an internal Gut logger to make better messages down the road.
* Experimental Full doubling allows you to Spy on most Built-in methods.  You still cannot Stub them though.  This must be enabled, details in the Double Wiki page.
* Added link to [Rainware's setup tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBbqlfmcAlc) to the README

## Fixes
* __Issue 94__ Gut runs `after_all` on inner classes that are skipped.
* Rawsyntax fixed a bunch of misspellings so that we can erock on with less bad speligs fo wrds.


# 6.6.1
* __Issue 60__:  Improved signal assert failure messages in some cases by having them include a list of signals that were emitted for the object.
* __Issue 88__:  Fixed issue where you couldn't specify the config_file from the command line.
* __Issue 95__:  Fixed issue where sometimes Gut can end up clearing files from `res:\\` when using doubling.

# 6.6.0
## Fixes
* __Issue 79__:  Scaling wasn't being accounted for by the `maximize` method.
* __Issue 80__:  Inner classes are no longer included in the count of scripts that were ran.

## Features
__Issue 83__: Added option to include subdirectories.  Thanks to __ChemicalInk__ for doing the initial work to implement the traversals.  The option is off by default so that it doesn't break anything.  This will probably change in later releases.
  * gutconfig:  include_subdirs
  * command line:  -ginclude_subdirs
  * editor: Include Subdirectories
  * Gut instance:  set/get_include_subdirectories()

__Issue 69__:  Renamed some methods.  The old names will remain but the documentation has been updated to reflect the new names.  If I ever end up removing the old names they will become deprecated for awhile and then removed in some later release.
  * `assert_get_set_methods` renamed to `assert_accessors` b/c it is easier to say
  * `assert_extends` renamed to `assert_is` b/c the keyword changed in gut 3.0

The setup/teardown methods got a rename so they are a little easier to understand.  You should use the new names going forward, but refactoring existing tests can be messy (see note below).
  * `prerun_setup` renamed to `before_all`
  * `setup` renamed to `before_each`
  * `postrun_teardown` renamed to `after_all`
  * `teardown` renamed to `after_each`

__Note about setup/teardown rename:__
  * The new methods could not be actual aliases due to how they are used internally.  They exist side by side with the old names and are called after the old methods.  __DO NOT use both in the same script.__
  * If you refactor your tests to use the new names, be careful wherever you have a test class that extends another test class and it calls `super`'s setup/teardown methods.  For example, if you rename `super`'s `setup` to `before_each` but all the test classes that inherit from it are still calling `.setup` then you'll have problem on your hands.

# 6.5.0

## Fixes
* Bug fix by __Xrayez__ to ensure that the command line tool always sets the return code properly.  Before it was only setting it if Gut was configured to exit when done.
* Fixed an issue where the command line tool wasn't setting options correctly when the .gutconfig.json file was present.  All options are now applied correctly based on order of precedence (default < gutconfig < cmd line).  I also added the `-gpo` command line option to print out all option values from all sources and what value would be used when running Gut.  This will make debugging theses issues easier later.

## Features
* We have two new asserts thanks to __hbergren__.  These asserts make it easier to assert if a value is within or outside of a +/- range of a value.  These are especially useful when comparing floats that the engine insists aren't equal due to rounding errors.
  * `assert_almost_eq(got, expected, error_interval, text='')` - Asserts that `got` is within the range of `expected` +/- `error_interval`.  The upper and lower bounds are included in the check.  Verified to work with integers, floats, and Vector2.  Should work with anything that can be added/subtracted.  <a href="https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Methods#assert_almost_eq">  Examples</a>
  * `assert_almost_ne(got, expected, error_interval, text='')` - This is the inverse of `assert_almost_eq`.  This will pass if `got` is outside the range of `expected` +/- `error_interval`.<a href="https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Methods#assert_almost_ne">  Examples</a>
* __Xrayez__ contributed a new option to maximize the Gut window upon launch.  The option can be set in the editor, .gutconfig, or at the command line.
* Added the `-gpo` command line option to print out all option values from all sources and what value would be used when running Gut.  This will make debugging option issues much easier.


## Other
Some housekeeping.  Removed some commented out and unreachable code.  Renamed a lot of tests in `test_test.gd` since it now uses Inner Test Classes which allows for better names.  They were setting a bad example for PRs.

# 6.4.0
I've "dog food"ed the doubles, stubs, and spies more in my own game and I think they are pretty stable.  This release contains some tweaks to doubles and stubs and the introduction of spies as well as some other testing goodness.

## Features
* `inner_class_name` option for editor node, command line, and .gutconfig.json.
* `assert_exports`:  Assert that script exports a variable with a specific type.  __Thanks Myrkrheim__
* Command line now returns `0` when all tests pass and `1` if there are any failures.  __Thanks cmfcmf.__
* You can now set the opacity for the GUI through a command line option or the `.gutconfig.json` file.  __That one is also thanks to Myrkheim__.
* Spies (experimental)
  * You can make assertions now about method calls on doubled objects.
  * `assert_called`
  * `assert_not_called`
  * `assert_call_count`

## Fixes
* Fixed issue with duplicate methods in doubled classes.

# 6.3.0

### Wiki
First, the [Readme has been broken up into a Github wiki](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki).  I think this will make consuming the help easier.  There is probably some room for improvement in the documentation and organization.  Create issues for anything that could be done better.

### Inner Test Classes
You can now create "Inner Classes" that run tests.  This allows you to breakup your tests and create multiple setup/teardown scopes in a single script.

Example:
``` python
extends "res://addons/gut/test.gd"

class TestInnerClass:
  extends "res://addons/gut/test.gd"

  func setup():
    pass

class TestInnerClass2:
  extends "res://addons/gut/test.gd"

  func setup():
    pass
```

### Command line config file
There is now support for a config file for the command line tool.  It only supports some options right now, but that will be expanded in the future.
``` json
{
  "dirs":["res://test/unit/", "res://test/integration/"],
  "should_exit":true,
  "ignore_pause":true,
  "log": 3
}
```

### Experimental Doubles and Stubs
There are also two new experimental features in this release.  Doubling and Stubbing.  These are experimental because their implementation could change a lot.  I hope not, but they might.  I fought with how these should work a lot, and honestly, I might have gotten it wrong.  So I'm going to put it out there and see how they get used in the wild.  I'm dedicated to keeping these features and improving on them, but they might be a little rough around the edges.

[You can find out more about Stubbing and Doubling in the Wiki.](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki)

### Yet another repo reorg
Big thanks to [cmfcmf](https://github.com/cmfcmf) for introducing me to `.gitattributes` and creating a PR to put the old repo structure back.  Now that I can easily exclude files from the exported zip file, this should be the last reorg or the repo.

# 6.2.0
* Some new asserts courtesy of Myrkrheim
``` python
assert_string_contains
assert_string_starts_with
assert_string_ends_with
assert_has_method
```
* Added .gitattributes which might make for less un-checkboxing when installing from Asset Library and less extra files when downloading the addon.  If this works out, then the next release will undo moving everything into `gut_tests_and_examples` and everything will be right in the world.  Thanks cmfcmf.

# 6.1.0
* Moved as many files as I could to `gut_tests_and_examples` so that there was less stuff to uncheck when installing via the in-engine Asset Library.  I'm still not 100% happy with the setup.
* Moved the License to `addons/gut/` so that it is distributed with the addon and doesn't accidentally get copied into the root of some other project when installed via the Asset Library.
* Some README tweaks.
* Fixed resize window handle bug.  It was connecting to wrong signals and didn't work.
* Missed changing `simulate` to call `_physics_process` instead of `_fixed_process` in the 3.0 conversion.  Fixed that.
* Improved summary.  It now lists all failures and pendings instead of just listing the scripts that have failures or pending tests.
* Fixed issue where the `signal_watcher` could try to disconnect from a freed object.
* Added `yield_to` which allows you to `yield` to a signal or a maximum amount of time.  This keeps your tests moving along if you yield to a signal that never gets emitted.  Now the test will fail after an amount of time instead of sitting in limbo forever.  This will also watch the signals on the object so you can make asserts about signals after the `yield` and you can save a line of code.
Example:
``` python
# wait for my_object to emit the signal 'my_signal'
# or 5 seconds, whichever comes first.
yield(yield_to(my_object, 'my_signal', 5), YIELD)
assert_signal_emitted(my_object, 'my_signal', \
                     'Maybe it did, maybe it didn\'t, but we still got here.')
```

# 6.0.0
* Godot 3.0 compatibility
* Combined GutTests repo so everything is now in one place.
* Fixed bug where prev/next were disabled incorrectly on startup.
* Some house keeping.

### Breaking Changes
No longer works with Godot 2.x, other than that everything remained the same.

# 5.0.1
* Fixed issue where `watch_signals` was not working with "Script Signals".  These are signals defined using the syntax `signal SomeSignal` instead of using `add_user_signal` to create them.
* Fixed a link in the README

# 5.0.0
This version mostly contains some long overdue house cleaning.  So that this wasn't JUST a reorganization release I also added an method for asserting instance type and inheritance and some minor tweaks.

### Breaking Changes (kinda) from 4.1.0
This change should only affect really old tests.  If you started using Gut later than 4.0 then you will most likely be ok.  The best approach to adjusting your tests is just to run them and see if it tells you that you are calling any methods that have been moved and then fixing them by removing the _`gut.`_ prefix.

Due to the restructuring I've completely moved the various `asserts` out of the core `gut` object and put them in the `test` object that all unit tests inherit from.  This means that any asserts or pending calls that are prefixed with _`gut.`_ need to have the _`gut.`_ prefix removed.  To cut down on the annoyance level of this change I've added stubs for the removed methods that fail with a message indicating that the method has been moved.


- New Methdos
  - `assert_extends` Asserts that an instance of an object inherits from the class passed.
- Some changes to the log output.
  - Quick summary about each test script is included at the end of the run.
  - Scripts that had a failing assert are listed together in the quick summary.
- Changed the GUI to have a fixed width font.  It makes formatting the output easier and I like it more.  Future changes should make customizing the GUI possible, so if you aren't fond of it you'll be able to change it sometime soon.
- All asserts were moved from the `gut` class to the `test` class so you don't need to prefix them.  Placeholder methods were put back into `gut` so your tests will run but fail with a message indicating the assert has been moved.

#### But Why?
When I first created Gut I tried to keep it all to a single file so that deployment was easier.  With the advent of the Addons system, I have a lot more freedom in structuring the files.  I had also based the structure of the classes on another unit test tool I had cobbled together for a procedural language.  This refactoring of the files will make changes easier in the future and separates out the various responsibilities into their own files and classes better.

# 4.1.0
- Added the ability to assert that signals did or did not fire.  By calling `watch_signals` Gut will monitor any signals emitted by the object.  You can then later make assertions about whether or not a signal was emitted or whether it emitted a desired number of times, and even if it was emitted and passed specific parameters.  You can also verify that the signal was emitted with the right parameters.  The following methods were added for this feature, see the README for more information about them.
	- `watch_signals`
	- `assert_signal_emitted`
	- `assert_signal_not_emitted`
	- `assert_signal_emitted_with_parameters`
	- `assert_signal_emit_count`
	- `assert_has_signal`
	- `get_signal_emit_count`
	- `get_signal_parameters`
- Some minor fixes to `gut.p`
	- It now performs a `str` on the input.  So if you pass it an object or something that isn't a string it won't blow up.
	- It now indents multi-line input correctly.


# 4.0.0
### Breaking Changes from 3.0.x and earlier

Before upgrading, remove gut.gd and gut_cmdln.gd from your your current project.  That will help ensure that you got everything setup right with the new install location.

0.  The install location has changed to `res://addons/gut`.  So you'll want to clean out wherever you had it previously installed.
0.  You'll want to update your existing scene to use the new plugin object.  Follow the new install instructions. <br>
__Note:__  just about everything you had to code to get your main testing scene running can now be configured in the Editor.  Select the Gut node and the options will appear in the Inspector.  Your existing code will work with the new custom node but using the Editor greatly simplifies things.
0.  The object that all test scripts must extend has changed to `res://addons/gut/test.gd`.
0.  All examples and tests for Gut itself have been moved to the new repo https://github.com/bitwes/GutTests/

### Earlier Versions:
- There were earlier versions, they had changes but I can't remember what they were.
