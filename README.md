# Gut 7.4.1 (Godot 3.x)
GUT (Godot Unit Test) is a unit testing framework for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).  It allows you to write tests for your gdscript in gdscript.

## Godot 4
The first version of GUT for Godot 4.0 has been released!  GUT version 9.0.0 can be found in the releases and in the Asset Library.  There are a lot of changes to GUT for Godot 4.0.  You can find a list of them in the [GODOT_4_README.md](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/blob/godot_4/GODOT_4_README.md).

For now Godot 4.0 versions of GUT will live in the [godot_4 branch](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/tree/godot_4).  At some point in the future (when people are using 4.0 more than 3.x) things will get reorganzied.
