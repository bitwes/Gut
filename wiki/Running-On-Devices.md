You may want to deploy your tests with your game so you can run tests on different devices and platforms.  GUT provides the handy `GutControl` to help you run your tests.
![GutControl](images/GutControl.png)


In order to run tests in a deployed game you must create a scene to kick off the tests from within the game.  Here's the steps:
* Create a scene
* Add a `GutControl` to the scene.
![AddGutControl](images/AddGutControl.png)
* Add a script to your scene and paste in the code below.
* You're off to the races.

Remember to add `*.json` in your export settings (resources tab), or your config file will not be exported with your game.

``` gdscript
# from https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/blob/godot_4/scripts/main.gd
#  and https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/blob/godot_4/scenes/main.tscn
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is an example of using the GutControl (res://addons/gut/gui/GutContro.tscn)
# to execute tests in a deployed game.
#
# Setup:
# Create a scene.
# Add a GutControl to your scene, name it GutControl.
# Add this script to your scene.
# Run it.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# signal callbacks.

	# You must load a gut config file to use this
	# control.

	# Here we use the Gut Panel settings file.  This can be any gutconfig file,
	# but this one is most likely to exist.  You can create your own just for
	# deployed settings.  You could even create multiple and have buttons to
	# load different configs.
	#
	# Some settings may not work.  For example, the exit flags do not have any
	# effect.

	# have to juggle the initial loading from res:// or user:// and save to
	# user://.
